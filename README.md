# Mortgage-Default-Probability-using-Anomaly-Detection
A logistic machine learning model to predict mortgage/loan default with 80% accuracy 

In order to create a model for predicting mortgage or loan defaults, we perform an initial data analysis on variables of our interest to see how they are correlated, followed by a detailed exploratory analysis of 15 selective variables (each commented with a reason for choosing the variable).

We further use variable selection methods like Stepwise Regression combined with Lasso regression to validate the significance of the variables chosen so we can come up with a Logistic model that contains the final set of variables which is a combination of both statistical as well as business significance. The accuracy of this Logistic model is further verified by creating a Gains table at the end.
